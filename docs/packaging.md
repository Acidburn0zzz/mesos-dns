##  Mesos-DNS Packaging

Mesos-DNS is a statically linked `go` binary. You can easily deploy it on its own. 

Alternatively, you can use the [Mesos-DNS packaging utility](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-dns-pkg) to generate packages for common Linux distributions. We will add tutorials on how to deploy these packages on various operating systems.
